\subsection{Conclusion}
As there are no clear difference in the results of the DTDCPT from the ordinary
DCPT algorithm, there are no clear conclusion to be made. The tendency seems to
be of the algorithm to run as DCPT, as the speedup seen is nearly identical to
that of DCPT. The DTDCPT algorithm is thus not worse than DCPT, and for other
tests than the test sets used, it might still yield an improvement.
