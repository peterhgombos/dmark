In this paper, an extension to Delta Correlating Prediction Table prefetching 
is presented, namely the Dynamic Tiered Delta Correlation Prediction Table
prefetching scheme. We present the changes to DCPT, and then examine how the
DTDCPT algorithm matches up against the original algorithm. There is not found
any significant improvement over DCPT by using Dynamic Tiers.
