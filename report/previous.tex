\subsection{Delta Correlating Prediction Tables}
In Grannæs et. al.\cite{Grannaes481837}, the DCPT prefetching scheme is
introduced. This scheme saves memory accesses in a table, indexed by their
Program Counter and together with the delta values, the arithmetic difference
between subsequent addresses of memory access. 

\subsection{Tiered Delta-Correlating Prediction Table Prefetching}
Sømåen et. al.\cite{Somaen} continued some of Grannæs et. al. further ideas, by
implementing a tiered version of the DCPT prefetching algorithm. Their
implementation features three full tiers, where all are stored at the same time,
and traversed each time an access is made.
