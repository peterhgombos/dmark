\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Background}

Relevant work we'll be looking at: \cite{Grannaes355273}, \cite{Grannaes481837}, \cite{Jahre355239}

\subsubsection{Delta Correlating Prediciton Tables}

\subsubsection{Tiered Delta Correlating Prediciton Tables}

The TDCPT~\cite{Somaen} aimed to improve upon DCPT~\cite{Grannaes481837}, by
adding "tiers" to the ring buffer-scheme that was used in DCPT. The reasoning
behind this was that a large amount of the accesses that filtered through the
scheme were only used a few times, without creating proper patterns. (50\%
according to Sømåen et al).

% TODO: Something about how it failed


\subsection{Prefetcher Description}

Our prefetcher (working title: Dynamically Tiered Delta Correlating Prediction
Tables) aims to have dynamically sized tiers to improve upon the potential
pitfalls that the original TDCPT-prefetcher fell into. Additionally it will
gather some statistics about the hit-rates for the various tiers to attempt to
decide better what size the various tiers should be, and whether or not to tier
at all.

% TODO: Fill in more when the architecture becomes a bit clearer.

\subsection{Methodology}

We will be investigating the value of dynamically tiering the DCPT by
implementing the algorithm in software and testing it with a subset of the SPEC
CPU2000 benchmark.  The algorithm will be implemented in C and run on the M5
simulator.
